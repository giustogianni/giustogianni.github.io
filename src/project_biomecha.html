							<h2>Shoulder range of motion evaluation</h2>
              <h5>Fall 2018</h5>
							<div>
								<h3>Abstract</h3>
									<p>
										Since shoulder problems represent a significant mass of hospital admissions,
										it is interesting to speed up consultations by improving the quality of angle measurements.
										This project aims to test the feasibility of potential solutions based on inertial measurement
										units (IMU) by assessing their accuracy for shoulder ROM recording. Those solutions should be
										compatible with several types of operating systems and adapted to the HUG database system.
									</p>

								<h3>Methods</h3>
								<p>
									<div>
										<b>Requirements</b>
										<p>
											In the present investigation, the clinical assessment of patient suffering from shoulder
											disorder is based on the <i>Score of Constant</i>. This metric attributes a score to the maximal
											amplitude reached by the patient for each shoulder independently. The severity of the disorder
											is finally quantified by calculating the difference between the healthy shoulder and the pathological one.
											The computation is based on the recording of shoulder range of motion of 4 axis, namely: <i>flexion</i>,
											<i>abduction</i>, <i>internal</i> and <i>external rotation</i>, without restriction in the degrees of freedom.
											As measuring tool, the use of IMU is frequent according to the literature and seems appropriate to achieve 5
											degrees precision, required in the context of this study.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<b>Interface</b>
										<p>
											The graphic user interface (GUI) was developed with the <b>Kivy</b> Python framework. It is an open source and
											cross-platform library, ideal for using the application on different operating systems.
										</p>
									</div>
								</p>


								<h3>Results</h3>
									<p>
										In this investigation, several trials were conducted to assess the performance of IMU for shoulder range of motion recording.
										Accelerometers turned out to be a reliable and effective solution to obtain precise measurements as they are less prone to
										subjectivity than actual methods. The algorithm implemented in the application provides an easy way to automate the process
										although time could be saved with real-time measurement via the Bluetooth connection.
